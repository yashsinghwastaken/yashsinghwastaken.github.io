                      Engineering as major 
            _______________________________________
  
  Figuring out a perfect major is pretty tough in itself, espasially in this system
  but the problem occur when you're not left with any of the choice, and that is the
  case for the PCM stream. Then you left with no choice, then the most stupid concecpt
  is of dividing the potential based on tier of there college, that is if you don't make
  it to the top few colleges, you're already fucked. Well certainly this sounds stupid as
  i am just writing this without any of the research, nor i have given this enough thought
  and honstely i don't want to. I just want to address this to the student who is probably
  thinking of taking engineering as there major, maybe give it a good thought first 
  and please do do keep tire of the college usually matter when hunting for a job.
