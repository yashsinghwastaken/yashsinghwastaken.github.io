Verse
=====

It is the crisp, chilly night after a child's
first Christmas Baron Street, save for a small crowd
gathered outside a boutique electronics store listening to the
man on the screen deliver a soliloquy about how
bad it is going to get, interspersed with advertisements
for Snuggies, Coco and Geico.
As the first flakes fall, we embrace in a Walgreens
parking lot, armed with only our persons and Tattered
tech company hoodies and with you pressed up against me, my
ever present companion, the racing inner monologue gives way to
the calm control of coming up on Adderwell and realizing
we are in a city of millions where nobody knows
us and we can just disappear and blend into the
ether like radio waves and no one will give us a second thought.
We make our way into a coffee shop where
we huddle together around a pumpkin spice latte, not
knowing how much longer this is all going to
last, but in this moment, not really caring.
We think, therefore we are, and no one is omipotent yet.
So let's vanish into the cracks of sidewalks, drink
from the Hudson River, and eat the remnants of
a civilization where people would continue to stare at
their phones while the hydrogen bombs detonate above them
and the sky is blacked out.
So they download a flashlight app and
make a dull witted comment about how Obama should fix the sun on Facebook.
We as people who aren't built for this world.
Why should we have to play by its arbitrary rules?
Can I get a show of hands of people who still think the Industrial revolution was a good idea?
We've dug ourselves into a hole, and instead of trying
to push the dirt back in it, we build dump
trucks to cart it away, excavators to dig it deeper,
drills to get through the bedrock, and lasers to ablate
the diamond while we run ad campaigns to push the
shiny rocks on soon to be bride's fingers.
Is it okay that we build a society where 13% of people are on antidepressants?
Maybe it's time to rethink the hole. Sure, the hole had your smartphone and flush toilets
in it, but it also had heroin and Twitter and drones and nuclear missiles, and we're digging more
frantically than ever and nobody is smart enough to know it lies even a little further down.
Never mind if we finally break through to the other side where the world is so upside down that we'll
literally have to lose ourselves to live in it. So maybe we should just stop fucking digging it.
But the unions will uproar, and without the
whole what would society do all day?
And there would always be some kid who thinks the hole is
the greatest thing ever and sneaks down with a shovel at night
just to move a little bit more dirt out of the way and lists friends to carry pails of it away.
And the dirt is far too scattered to ever fill the hole back up anyway.
So why should we even try?
Let's just sip and sip joint latte and when it's done,step out into the night and hold each other as wall flowers with the storm rolling in as people hustle and bustle
by all looking like they are going somewhere.
And if anyone bothered to notice us, we'd be the freaks were just standing there.
